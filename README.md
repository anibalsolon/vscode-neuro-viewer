If you got here, you might be familiar with Nifti files. In any case, Nifti is a file format for neuroimaging.
This extension allows the user to visualize the volumetric data in Nifti files, and more features are coming!

## Features

A quick way to view your Nifti files. It shows some metadata and renders a volume!

## Known Issues
